# Validation and Verification: Practical Session #2

The goal of this practical session is to use and implement static analysis tools to compute metrics such as Cyclomatic Complexity(CC) or Tight Class Cohesion (TCC).
After this session you should be able to use existing static analysis tools, and to extend them to implement your own analysis.
